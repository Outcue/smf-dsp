# Building

To build the software, type `make` in the source directory.

Install following packages on Debian/LibraZiK/Mint:

- `build-essential` `git` `pkg-config` `libsdl2-dev` `libasound2-dev` `libjack-jackd2-dev` `libuv-dev` `libuchardet-dev`

(in case JACK 1 is preferred over JACK 2, replace `libjack-jackd2-dev` with `libjack-dev`)

Immediately after building, the program is available by starting `./fmidiplay`.

## Building synthesizers

The optional synthesizers have additional requirements, and they are built only if these are present.

- **Fluidsynth**: install the package `libfluidsynth-dev`.
- **FM-OPL3 (ADLMIDI)**: check out external sources into the tree, as follows.  
  `git clone https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI.git thirdparty/libADLMIDI`
- **FM-OPN2 (OPNMIDI)**: check out external sources into the tree, as follows.  
  `git clone https://github.com/Wohlstand/libOPNMIDI.git thirdparty/libOPNMIDI`
- **SCC (emidi)**: check out external sources into the tree, as follows.  
  `git clone https://github.com/jpcima/scc.git thirdparty/scc`
